					  		<p>
								As the gravity of the situation settled into our communities, we realized that there are many in our vicinity who do not have access to basic needs - food, hygiene, and shelter. As college students, who have the privilege of having a shelter during this pandemic, we wanted to extend support to those without a place to shelter.

								With coronavirus aid kits created by your donations, we hope to do more to prevent the spreading of the virus to our homeless community. We believe in the strength of our community, in our ability to fight for each other. Let's get through this pandemic together so we get time to go outside and enjoy the spring.
