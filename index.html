				<h1>How can we help the homeless in our own homes?</h1>
				<p>As the gravity of COVID-19 settled into our communities, we realized that there are many in our vicinity who do not have access to basic needs— food, hygiene, and shelter. As college students, who have the privilege of having shelter during this pandemic, we wanted to extend support to those without.</p>

				<h1>While we shelter in place, they have no place to shelter</h1>
				<p> With coronavirus aid kits created by your donations, we hope to do more to prevent the spreading of the virus to our homeless community. We believe in the strength of our community and in our ability to fight for each other. By supporting Corody, you are planting hope into our future— and without hope we cannot overcome COVID-19. </p>

				<h2>Step 1</h2>
				<p>BUILD. Do you have extra pantry goods or sanitary products you can share with the homeless people? Build a kit with items you think will provide support to the homeless during this pandemic. </p>

				<h2>Step 2</h2>
				<p>SEND. During this crisis, we are working hard to come up with what would facilitate you the most in sending kits. Currently our options are: drop-off, pick-up and mail. Thank you for understanding.</p>

			<div class="second-section-text">
				<h2>Step 3</h2>
				<p>SHARE. After building and sending your kit by completing the form below, share with your friends and family so that we can continue support. The more words you disperse, the more kits we disperse!</p>
