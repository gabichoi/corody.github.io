				<h1>How can we help the homeless in our own homes?</h1>
				<p>As the gravity of COVID-19 settled into our communities, we realized that there are many in our vicinity who do not have access to basic needs— food, hygiene, and shelter. 
				While staying in home, we realized how having shelter during this pandemic is a privilege. By creating Corody, we want to provide support to our homeless community who are let outside with no place to take refuge.</p>

				<h1>While we shelter in place, they have no place to shelter</h1>
				<p> Help us build a kit by sharing items that will provide support to the homeless during this pandemic or by giving us funding we need to purchase the items.We believe in the strength of our community and in our ability to fight for each other. By supporting Corody, you are blooming hope into our future— and without hope we cannot overcome COVID-19. </p>

We are committed to aid those who are the most exposed and vulnerable to COVID-19: the homeless community.
